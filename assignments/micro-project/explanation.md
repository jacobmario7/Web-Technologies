## **Shadows:**
Box shadows are applied to certain elements like .card and .column to create a raised effect, making the elements appear lifted off the page. The shadow adds depth and improves the visual hierarchy.
**(Here shadows are used in th e div tag of class = ‘card’ which makes the page look like lifted off the page and makes it visually appealing)** 

## **Text:** 
Various text-related stylings are used across the document. For instance, the color of the text in header, nav, .section, and .card elements is defined using CSS variables. Text hover effects are applied to change the color of links when hovered, improving user interactivity. Fonts are set globally to sans-serif and Arial, providing a clean look.
**(Here the text color of cards and nav tags are changed and the font size increases in blockquote when the cursor is hovered over them)**

## **Transitions:** 
Transitions are applied to elements like .card, .nav a, and .column. These transitions smoothly change properties such as width, height, background color, and transform over a defined period (e.g., 2 seconds for .card). This enhances user experience by making interactions more dynamic.
**(Here the transition effect is applied to the div tag of class = ‘card’ which makes the cards move upwards and the colors change too when hovered over them)**

## **Transformations:** The transform property is used to apply effects like rotation and translation. For example, the .card element rotates 360 degrees when hovered, while elements like .column and .highlight-box are translated slightly upwards to simulate a hover lift effect.
**(Here the transformation effect is applied to the div tag of class = ‘card’ which makes the box to rotate 360 degree)**

## **Animations:**
Keyframe animations are used for text in .section h2. The colorChange animation cycles through different text colors, creating a dynamic and eye-catching effect. This animation is set to loop infinitely over 2 seconds, making the header text more visually engaging.
**(Here animation effect is used on the h2 tags which makes them to cycle between different colors make the page attractive)**
